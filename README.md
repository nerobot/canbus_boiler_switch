### 17th October 2019

* Branch v1.2 has been implemented as the boiler switch and is working quite well. 
* Real world testing for about 1 week shows that it is working well, being able to switch the boiler on and off as needed without any signal conflict. However, since the system only has the two nodes, it's possible that I'm simply missing something due to the simplicity of the system.
* Since this branch is working as expected, it will be merged into the master brach and work will start on the v2 branches.
